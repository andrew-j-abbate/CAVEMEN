# CAVEMEN
Connectibility Affordance Verification, Modeling, and Enumeration (CAVEMEN)

This repository contains the CAVEMEN tool, XML schema, and case-study models described in the IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems article "A formal approach to connectibility affordances" (under review).

To run CAVEMEN, open the file cavemen.html in Chrome 68+, Safari 11+, Firefox 61+, or Edge 42+.

To view the case-study models, open the .sal files in the "pacemaker system models" directory (viewing recommended in Atom 1.13+ with the language-SAL package installed: https://github.com/andrew-j-abbate/language-SAL).
